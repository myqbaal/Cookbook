# The Data Engineering Cookbook
I get asked super often how to become a Data Engineer.
That's why I decided to start this cookbook with all the topics you need to look into.

It's not only useful for beginners, professionals will definitely like the case study section.

Here's the **download** shortcut: \

## How to use the cookbook
I split this cookbook into five parts
+ Part one is the introduction to the book
+ In part two you will learn the basic data engineering skills
+ Part three contains a real world data engineering example we currently work on
+ The fourth part contains over 30 case studies with links from companies like Netflix, Twitter, Spotify
+ Part five is a collection of one thousand and one interview questions (currently approx. 150)

## How to contribute
If you have some cool links or topics for the cookbook, please become a contributor.
Simply open an issue and add your links. Or pull the repo, add them and create a pull request.

Please pull only the "working-branch" branch. \
This way we keep the master branch clean and I don't have to mess around resolving conflicts. You just need to change the .tex file. I'll recompile it later when I merge the branch with the master

For comments please also use the "Issues" function.
